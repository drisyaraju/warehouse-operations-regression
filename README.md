## 🔍 What's This About?

Every second counts in a warehouse. A delayed order means a frustrated customer.

**WarehouseIQ** uses regression analysis and machine learning to **predict order processing time** — giving warehouse managers the foresight to optimize operations, allocate staff, and slash bottlenecks before they happen.

## 🧠 Models Benchmarked

| Model | Type | Strengths |
|---|---|---|
| 📈 Simple Linear Regression | Baseline | Interpretable, fast |
| 📊 Multiple Linear Regression | Statistical | Multi-feature relationships |
| 🌀 Polynomial Regression | Non-linear | Captures curved patterns |
| 🌳 Decision Tree | Tree-based | Handles non-linearity, visual |
| 🌲 **Random Forest** | Ensemble ⭐ | **Best performer** |
| ⚡ Support Vector Machine | Kernel-based | Robust on high-dimensional data |

> 🏆 **Random Forest** emerged as the top model — outperforming simpler regressors by capturing complex, non-linear interactions in warehouse data.

## 📐 Statistical Rigour

This project goes beyond just fitting models — it validates them:

- **Overall F-test** → Is the model as a whole statistically significant?
- **Partial F-test** → Which individual predictors actually matter?

Because a model that *looks* good but isn't statistically sound is just noise.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells Us |
|---|---|
| **R² Score** | How much variance in processing time the model explains |
| **RMSE** | How far off predictions are, penalizing large errors |
| **MAE** | The average absolute prediction error in real units |

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Tree-based ensemble methods** significantly outperform linear approaches on warehouse data — the relationships between features are inherently non-linear.
- **Feature selection** was critical: not all warehouse variables contribute meaningfully to processing time.
- **Statistical testing** confirmed that the top model's predictors weren't just noise — they had genuine explanatory power.
